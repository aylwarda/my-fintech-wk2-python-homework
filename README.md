### Programiz
- While reading up about how I could determine whether a file has a header row or not, I started building my own logic for determining whether a header exists in a given files, and then stumbled across the Programiz (programiz.com) site and found some cool little tips and tricks; csv sniffer references found [here](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/reading-csv-files).
